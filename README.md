<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aadhamilibeo/weather-vue/master/screenshot.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- **Where can I see your demo?** \
   Demo URL :https://weather-vue-eight.vercel.app/ \
    Git URL: https://github.com/aadhamilibeo/weather-vue 
- **What was your experience?** \
    I feel very proud of libeo and myself for exploring the new development skills in me and doing a lot of research work day in and day out to commence the work allotted to me. I was very naive with Vue but have learned a lot in my journey of working on this app. 
- **What have you learned/improved?** \
    Watched a lot of learning tutorials. Learned the basic concepts of vue including the component life cycle of vue. Leaned the data structure and flow of data in vue.  
    When the basic got cleared then I moved on to nuxt.js and learned how to create dynamic pages and global storage and how to handle fetch and axios APIs in nuxt.js
- **Your wisdom? :)** \
    I really enjoyed working on the weather app. Looking forward to the next tasks :)
